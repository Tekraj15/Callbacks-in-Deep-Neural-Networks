# Callbacks in Model Training
Building Deep Learning models without callbacks is like driving a car with no functioning brakes â€” you have little to no control over the whole process that is very likely to result in a disaster. In this repository, you'll learn how to monitor and improve your Deep Learning models using Keras callbacks like ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping
# Callback
A callback is a set of functions to be applied at given stages of the training procedure. You can use callbacks to get a view on internal states and statistics of the model during training.
